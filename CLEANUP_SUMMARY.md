## 📊 Results

### Before Cleanup
- ❌ Inconsistent code formatting
- ❌ Missing type safety
- ❌ Poor error handling
- ❌ Inadequate documentation
- ❌ Unorganized project structure
- ❌ Missing development tools

### After Cleanup
- ✅ Consistent code formatting with Prettier
- ✅ Strict TypeScript type checking
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Extensive documentation
